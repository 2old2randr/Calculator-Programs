Battery.s is a small System RPL program that when compiled (using MASD on
the calculator) will result in a 219 byte program. When run, it displays
the battery voltage on the top line of the display with an estimate of the
remaining charge (good / charge / bad).

If running on USB power, it will show 0 volts.
